        "linkedin_org_description": "Jazz House Kids began as a spark of inspiration that was brought about when radio station WBGO asked professional jazz vocalist Melissa Walker to host a children’s jazz workshop.  This experience was so positive that Melissa knew she wanted to continue bringing her passion for jazz music to children.  \r\n\r\nInitially, this took the form of an assembly program that Melissa and a small group of friends would present at local schools.  However, it soon began to grow into something much bigger.  Jazz House Kids officially received its non-profit (501-C) status in 2002.   In 2014, Melissa was honored as one of NJBIZ Magazine’s “Best Women in Business.”\r\n\r\nAt Jazz House Kids, our mission is to “bridge the gap” created when budget cuts cause schools to have poor music programs or no music programs at all.  We want to give all students the opportunity to have their lives transformed by exposure to high quality music education.  \r\n\r\nAs America’s original style of music, jazz is a national treasure!  But it is also an excellent teaching tool.  Students learning to play jazz also learn important skills that will help them become successful adult members of society.  Included in these skills are greater confidence, perseverance, focus, collaboration, dedication, accountability, and the ability to receive constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nOur mission has three main areas of focus: \r\n\r\nOur school-based programs have served more than 30,000 New Jersey students and given them the opportunity to perform before half a million people.\r\n\r\nOur in–house classes and ensembles are recognized for producing many of the nation’s top young musicians.\r\n\r\nOur presence in the community is teaching students to become invested citizens at home and in the world at large.  Students perform at countless “giglets” each year that support local nonprofit organizations, WBGO and senior citizens facilities.  Also, each year since 2010, Jazz House Kids has presented the free, family-friendly Montclair Jazz Festival.",

Those plans came to fruition in 1986 with the founding of Thompson Thrift.\nSince that time, Thompson Thrift has grown from a locally focused development and construction company into an integrated, full-service real estate company with a national scope.\n\nThompson Thrift’s commitment to Excellence, Service, and Leadership has been and will remain a hallmark of the company as it continues to move into the future.\n\nAt Thompson Thrift, each project is a partnership with our stakeholders - investors, residents, tenants, vendors, and team members. We promote a working environment in which communication and service are essential. We embrace a philosophy of transparency in conducting business and are proud of the culture of customer service we have developed.\n\nOur business model provides us with the in-house capabilities necessary to acquire a site, perform feasibility and due diligence, design and construct, then lease, sell or manage it.

Much as we love our yellow trucks and our Little Man logo, we hope the most important thing that comes to mind is our service. The best customer service for a fair price has been the foundation of our business since we first opened in 1921. In a business climate where change is constant, we're proud to still have the same values that have led to our growth and success for over 90 years.\r\n\r\nWhen we make a commitment, we stand behind it; we have a family reputation and tradition to uphold. It's part of our history, and our future. In a disposable world, longevity can sometimes seem a little old-fashioned. But at Western Exterminator Company, we believe that excellence will never go out of style and that treating people (and customers) the way you wish to be treated is the secret to success in business, and in life. This was the vision of our founder, Carl Strom, and continues as our mission today.\r\n\r\nWe're also proud to offer the services of the most highly-trained professionals in the industry. Western's on-staff entomologists and pest control professionals are second to none. We offer fast service. Flexible scheduling. And the promise of 100% satisfaction. Guaranteed.",

Our partners benefit from the expertise we provide, and we benefit from theirs.  Even though Bridgewell has grown to become a global organization serving retailers, manufacturers and niche markets all over the world, we haven't lost touch with our Pacific Northwest roots.  \n\nLeaders in top-quality agricultural and food products, Bridgewell has two goals: to partner with our customers in order to solve current supply-chain challenges, and to create sales opportunities in the food and agricultural markets.  We achieve these by adhering to a strict set of core values - values that reflect and shape our priorities, our partnerships, and the types of products we sell.  These values are our guidelines, and the relationships that result from them are the reason we're in business.  Our vision is simple: deliver high-quality food and agricultural products from origin to customer with excellent value and total traceability.\n",

The firm was founded in 1972 by Robert E. Torray, who viewed common stock as a partial interest in a business, which allowed him to invest with a long-term owner’s mindset. Throughout the subsequent decades and market cycles, the firm has steadfastly provided concentrated portfolios of select businesses with strong fundamentals, applied a thoughtful approach to risk management, and maintained a long-term perspective. These enduring principles form the foundation of the investment philosophy and process that drive our active concentrated strategies. \n\nTorray is 100 percent independent, owned by the people responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of client capital. Our partnership approach and client centric culture guide us and underpin the way we do business. Currently, we express our disciplined risk managed investment approach across four concentrated portfolios.",
